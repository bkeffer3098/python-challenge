# python-challenge

This is the ReadMe for my Module 3 Challenge on Python. I have worked closely on this assignment with one of my group members, Janka Glenn, to complete my code in areas that I struggled with. I also utilized the links below to assist me in  utilizing the dictionary I had created and how to correctly convert the date structure in the PyBank assignment.
